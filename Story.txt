 Once upon a time, in a forest full of creatures from your wildest imaginations, there lived inside a tinyyet cozy hut,
 Hansel and her sister Gretel with their father and their stepmother. Their father was a woodcutter. Times were tough and they had very
  little food to eat. Their stepmother was very evil and didn't give them food. Once they wandered off in the forest in search of berries.
  They took some bread crumbs in their pockets and dropped them along the way so they could find their way back. Later, night was falling, 
  but they had lost their way. They realized that the birds had eaten the crumbs and now they were in the middle of the forest with no clue
  of where they were.
